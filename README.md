# Call Center Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard is designed to monitor key operational metrics and provide actionable insights into call center performance. This dashboard incorporates crucial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess customer satisfaction, agent performance, call handling efficiency, and time-based trends. With creative data visualizations, the dashboard empowers Claire to make data-driven decisions for process improvements and enhanced customer experience.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following fields:
- **Call Id**: Unique identifier for each call.
- **Agent**: Name of the agent handling the call.
- **Date & Time**: Timestamp of when the call occurred.
- **Topic**: Call topic, including categories like Contract-related, Payment-related, Technical Support, Admin Support, and Streaming.
- **Answered (Resolved)**: Indicates whether the call was answered and resolved (Yes/No).
- **Speed of Answer**: Time (in seconds) taken to answer a call.
- **Average Talk Duration**: Average time (hh:mm:ss) spent handling a call.
- **Satisfaction**: Customer feedback score (on a scale of 1-5).

---
## Dashboard Requirements
The following KPIs and metrics have been incorporated into dashboard:

1. **Overall Customer Satisfaction**:
   - Tracks customer feedback ratings to measure the quality of service provided.

2. **Overall Calls Answered vs. Abandoned**:
   - Monitors call center efficiency by comparing the ratio of calls answered to calls abandoned.

3. **Calls by Time**:
   - Analyzes call distribution throughout the day to identify peak and off-peak activity periods.

4. **Average Speed of Answer**:
   - Measures the time taken for agents to respond to incoming calls, highlighting agent responsiveness.

5. **Agent’s Performance Quadrant**:
   - Visualizes agent efficiency by comparing average handle time (talk duration) against the number of calls answered. This categorization supports targeted coaching and recognition.

## Dashboard Features

### 1. **Overall Customer Satisfaction**
- **Visualization**: A bar chart displaying customer satisfaction scores (1-5) across all call topics and agents.
- **Insights**: Highlights areas of service excellence and points of customer dissatisfaction.

### 2. **Answered vs. Abandoned Calls**
- **Visualization**: Pie chart comparing the percentage of answered and abandoned calls.
- **Insights**: Helps track efficiency in handling incoming calls and identifies patterns leading to abandonment.

### 3. **Calls by Time**
- **Visualization**: Line chart showing call volumes across hours of the day.
- **Insights**:
  - Identifies peak hours to optimize staffing.
  - Determines low-traffic times for process adjustments.

### 4. **Average Speed of Answer**
- **Visualization**: Gauge chart showcasing the average time (in seconds) taken to answer calls.
- **Insights**: Tracks how quickly customer queries are addressed and identifies response bottlenecks.

### 5. **Agent Performance Quadrant**
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot with average talk duration vs. total calls answered.
- **Quadrant Insights**:
  - High calls, low talk time: Top-performing agents.
  - Low calls, high talk time: Agents requiring additional support.

### 6. **Topic-Based Filters**
- **Feature**: Select specific call topics (e.g., Payment-related, Technical Support) to focus on trends for different query categories.
- **Insights**: Understand which topics drive higher satisfaction or contribute to frequent unresolved calls.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

### 1. **Call Handling Efficiency**:
- **Answered vs. Abandoned Calls**: A significant percentage of calls are abandoned during peak hours (9 AM–12 PM), pointing to insufficient staffing during high-traffic periods.
- **Speed of Answer**: Delays in response times are more prominent during peak hours, contributing to call abandonment and reduced satisfaction.
- **Unresolved Calls**: Issues in categories like Technical Support and Payment-related queries exhibit longer talk durations and lower resolution rates, affecting customer satisfaction.

### 2. **Agent Performance**:
- **Efficiency Trends**: Top-performing agents handle higher call volumes with shorter average talk durations, boosting operational efficiency.
- **Improvement Areas**: Agents with extended talk durations and fewer resolved calls may require additional training to enhance their performance.
- **Resolution Rates**: Efficient agents consistently resolve queries faster, resulting in higher customer satisfaction.

### 3. **Customer Satisfaction**:
- **Overall Trends**: Higher satisfaction scores are associated with quicker responses and resolved queries.
- **Topic-Specific Satisfaction**: Admin Support and Streaming-related issues yield higher satisfaction levels, while Payment-related queries show lower ratings due to delays in resolution.
- **Impact of Response Time**: Faster answering times correlate with higher satisfaction, emphasizing the importance of speed in call handling.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Staffing**:
   - Increase staffing during peak hours (9 AM–12 PM) to reduce abandoned calls and better manage high call volumes.
   - Use predictive scheduling to ensure adequate coverage during high-traffic times.

2. **Enhance Agent Training**:
   - Focus on agents with longer average talk durations and low resolution rates to improve their efficiency.
   - Provide specialized training for handling complex queries in categories like Technical Support and Payment-related issues.

3. **Improve Response Times**:
   - Implement streamlined workflows or integrate automated solutions to reduce response delays, especially during busy periods.
   - Use real-time monitoring tools to help prioritize urgent calls effectively.

4. **Address Topic-Specific Challenges**:
   - Allocate skilled resources to improve resolution rates for frequently unresolved topics such as Technical Support and Payment-related queries.
   - Refine processes to ensure consistent service quality across all topics.

5. **Leverage High Performers**:
   - Recognize and reward top-performing agents to maintain high morale and motivation.
   - Use high-performing agents’ expertise to mentor colleagues who need additional support or coaching.
